# MEAN Stack Blank Slate
A clean, simple template for any MEAN stack app.

This template aims to provide the industry standard essentials for any MEAN stack app, following standard conventions for file structure, naming conventions, and code organization.  The intent is to provide a platform that is easy to navigate because everything is where you expect it, that has everything that you knew you were going to need and as little as possible that you don't.

Goals:
1. Error-free code.
2. Include features that are common to all apps.
3. Limit as much as possible that would require removal or modification.
4. Consistent, predictable organization, structure, and convention.
